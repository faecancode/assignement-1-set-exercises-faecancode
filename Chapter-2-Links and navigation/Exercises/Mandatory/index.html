            Long ago, the Elden Ring brought prosperity to the Lands Between. <br>
            But one day it was shattered. The shards, great runes of enormous power fell into the hands of the demigods. <br>
            And although the demigods fought for control, in the end there was no victor.

        <p class="content">  
            And so began an era without a Lord… <br>
            Until, from across the Sea of Fog, a Tarnished of no renown arrives at the Lands Between. <br>
            The Tarnished takes their first steps into the world, knowing not what awaits them. <br>
            Greetings traveler, from beyond the fog. I am Melina. I offer you an accord. <br>
            The Tarnished accepts Melina's request, and begins a journey to bring her to the base of the Erdtree. <br>
            As they explore, the Lands Between become known to the Tarnished. And they gain power, shaping themselves in their own way. <br>
            Throughout their journey, they cross paths with unlikely allies. <br>
            Death has left its mark, once again. <br>
            Rise with us, against the Erdtree.

            So much power, in the hands of one Tarnished. Growing in strength, with every triumph. <br>
            Who crossed the fog to the Lands Between. To stand before the Elden Ring.<br>
            And become the Elden Lord.<br>
            The Lands Between… are yours to discover.

            "Elden Ring is a masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. <br>
            Elden Ring doesn't impose any particular playstyle or route on you. <br>
            You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. <br>
            It is truly refreshing to feel this sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open world game."

        <p class="content"> 
            "This game is my absolute favorite soulslike game and is one of my favorite RPG games <br>
            along side the Witcher 3 and breath of the wild. Like all souls like games the combat is extremely <br>
            challenging but unlike others if you get stuck on a boss that hinders your game progression you can <br>
            simply go off and explore more of the map and simply come back later." </p>

        <p class="content">
            "this game is the most beautiful game ever. The world building, art style and use of beautiful buildings <br>
            aswell as sheer size of the map form together a beautiful concoction for players to navigate. <br>
            If you love video games, you have to give Elden Ring a shot. It is a emotion filled journey <br>
            that every fan of gaming needs in their life!"
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            "There is a true sense of accomplishment once that rock-hard enemy has been slain and, something that<br> 
            compels a player to relentlessly do it over and over again until they succeed is truly rewarding."
